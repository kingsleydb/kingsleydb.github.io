Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not. 
All of the required content is uploaded and readable to the general public. I've also included a link bar that has links connecting the current webpage with the other two on the site. 

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignement.
Thank you to Tati Doyle, who pointed me to the correct webpage so I could create the kingsleydb.github.io page. 

Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
It took me approximately 4 or 5 hours to figure out what Git was, complete the lab, make the pages, and debug.
