    I am from Cleveland Ohio. I have two older brothers, Ted and Tim. They are both older than I am. I also have a cat. I like my cat, but I don't love it. She is not the nicest cat I have ever met. I swim for the Tufts Mens swimming and diving team. I like the people on the team. Tufts people are cool and nice sometimes.
