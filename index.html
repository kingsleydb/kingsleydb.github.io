        The more I understand about technology, the more it baffles me. </br> </br>

At my first IT internship, I created an Amazon Alexa skill prototype. Before that project, I never considered that people could interact with a computer without using a keyboard.</br> </br>

The following summer I worked at Tufts University's Human-Computer Interaction lab as a research assistant. My team conducted research using a functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) machine; the fNIRS machine used lasers to collect data about a human brain. We used this data as input to a machine learning algorithm that made predictions about the state of the user. Before this research, I never considered that people could interact with computers without explicitly doing anything. </br></br>

Now, I am interested in blockchain technology. For my first full-time software development position, I worked for a venture capital-backed start up company that developed enterprise Hyperledger Fabric solutions for both car titling and birth/death certificates.</br></br>

When I am not coding, you can often find me playing guitar, swimming, or grappling on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu mats. I enjoy being outside, being a member of a team, and keeping a growth mindset.</br></br>

            <p> Ownum is a venture capital-backed start up parent company that specializes in blockchain solutions. Its subsidiary companies, Champtitles and VitalChain, worked with car titling and birth/death certificates respectively. While I was employed by Ownum, I worked only with Champtitles's Hyperledger Fabric enterprise solution. During my time at Ownum, I was a member of two development teams: the java API team and the Hyperledger Fabric team, where I spent most of my time. I learned a lot about the way start up companies function, java software development, Hyperledger Fabric, and software design. </p>

            <p> This was a wonderful experience for me because I was able to explore two interests of mine: exploratory computer science research and mindfulness. During my time at the lab, I recieved hands-on experience with cutting-edge Human-Computer Interaction technology, and my research partner was a Zen Buddhist monk prior to starting his Ph.D. in computer science. My technical contribution to the project was developing an adaptable data filter that used regular expressions and an existing Java code base that I translated into Python 3. This filter cleaned all data from the functional near infared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for input to machine learning software. The project team was ultimately able to distingush periods of rest, singular tasks, and multiple tasks from implicit brain data. This study is on-going. </p>

        <p> Outside of software development, I have lots of interests. 
      
            <br> <br> 
            Swimming has always played a large role in my personal development. Through swimming, I've learned how to be a team player, how to cooperate, and how to balance a demanding schedule. Throughout my swimming career, I became a captain of both my high school and college swim teams, a 2x Ohio  high school swimming state champion, a multiple time DIII NCAA All-American (most in Tufts University history), a US Open qualifier, and the 2019 New England Small College Athletic Conference Swimmer of the Year. 
            <br> <br> 
            I also love playing music. Growing up, I played piano, viola, and guitar. In high school, I joined the University School jazz band, where I got the opportunity to perform at Cleveland's House of Blues. In college, I played lead guitar in the Kinder Bueno band, performed with friends at social gatherings, and performed with the Tufts University Third Day Gospel choir for three semesters. On top of that, I took several music classes including music theory and songwriting. 
            <br> <br>
            After graduating from college, I realized that I still have my competitive fire, so I joined a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym. I am currently a one stripe white belt.
