            <p> This was a wonderful experience for me because I was able to explore two interests of mine: exploratory computer science research and mindfulness. During my time at the lab, I was able to get hands on experience with cutting-edge Human-Computer Interaction technology, and my research partner was a practicing Zen Buddhist monk prior to starting his Ph.D. in computer science. My technical contribution to the project was developing an adaptable data filter that used regular expressions and an existing Java code base that I translated into Python 3. This filter cleaned all data from the functional near infared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for input to machine learning software. The project team was ultimately able to distingush periods of rest, singular tasks, and multiple tasks from implicit brain data. This study is on-going. </p>

The skill was written in Node.js using Alexa SDK, Twilio API, and AWS Lambda. </p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
        <p> Outside of software development, I have lots of interets. 
            <br> <br> 
            Perhaps the hardest interest to quantify would be my interest in people. Everyone has their own unique experiences, and, consequently, I approach people as if they know something I do not. 
            <br> <br> 
            Swimming has always played a large role in my personal development. Through swimming, I've learned how to be a team player, how to get along with others who have differing perspectives, how to work relentlessly, how to lead, and how to follow. Throughout my swimming career, I became a captain of both my high school and college swim teams, a two time Ohio  high school swimming state champion, a 20x DIII NCAA All-American (most in Tufts University history), a US Open qualifier, and the 2019 New England Small College Athletic Conference Swimmer of the Year. 
            <br> <br> 
            I also love playing music. Growing up, I played piano, viola, and guitar. In middle school, I was the violist section leader in the school orchestra. In high school, I joined the University School jazz band. In college, I played lead guitar in the Kinder Bueno band, occasionally performed with friends at social gatherings, and was a member of the Third Day Gospel choir for three semesters. On top of that, I took several music classes including music theory and songwriting. 
            <br> <br> 
            During my sophomore year of college, I learned about mindfulness and meditation, which changed the way I experience and think of the world and my place in it. 
            <br> <br> 
            I have many other interests, but I would say these four interests speak the most about my character and personality. Thank you for taking the time to read about me!
