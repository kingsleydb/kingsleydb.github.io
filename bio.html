    <h1> Biography </h1> 
    
    My name is Kingsley Bowen. I am a 2019 graduate from Tufts University with a bachelors of science in computer science.  At Tufts, I was a four year varsity swimmer, a swim team captain, and a 20x NCAA All-American. I currently love playing music, practicing meditation, and learning about the current state of the tech industry.
